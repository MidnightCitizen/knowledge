> ❝ Man should strive to simplify his life as ardently as he strives to complicate it. ❞
> — Henry Bergson

Without order, only chaos. Burnout happened because the energy is used to complicate things instead of working to *simplify* your life. 

**Each day should be considered as the last** and be used fully, not been wasted for useless pleasures. 

You have to *schedule your time* and prepare your present/future with dedication. **Not having a plan is the worst thing for you**, right now, and for your future self.

In one year, five years, ten years: the choice that you made today will have a huge impact. So, one rule: simplify, simplify, simplify. 

* Don't read every tech news
* Allow some time to relax
* Focus on your life
* Review each week where you are, where you want to be
* Todo-list is not a magic wand: keep it to only three items each day
* Do some meditation to allow your mind to breathe

## Notes

[[system_not_goals]] -> you should focus on the system/process, not the ending, hence you should simplify your life
