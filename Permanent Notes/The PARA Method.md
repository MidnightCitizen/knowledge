P.A.R.A stands for Projects Areas Resources Archives, a system to store and find informations.

The four concepts / pillars of this method :
- Project : A series of tasks with a deadline
*Example* : Develop project plan, Write blog post, Complete app mockup
- Area of responsibility : A category that need to looked at without time limit
*Example* : Writing, Health, Apartment, Travel 
- Resource : An interesting topic
*Example* : SEO, Music, Architecture
- Archives : Abandoned or completed elements of the other three categories
*Example* : Projects done, Areas no longer interested in

The first two concepts, Project and Area of Responsibility, must be clearly differentiated: the first is a series of divided tasks, the second contains different projects

The main idea behind PARA is to have projects with tasks and create momentum by being able to see quickly what has to be done, do it, and move on.
