Rather than sleeping, the night is used in part for other activities that are perceived to be more exciting than sleeping. The word "revenge" refers to the fact that this is also a way of taking revenge for the absence of control over the day, resulting in a desire to manage the night as one would like to. 

The boomerang effect is that you end up getting less sleep time, so the day is more difficult, and the phenomenon of procrastination at night is repeated, which creates a negative loop.
