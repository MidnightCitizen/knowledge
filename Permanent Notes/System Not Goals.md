One of the most important mistakes that we can make when starting to have "good" habits is to think about goals.   
I will have done writing this novel before the end of the year. I intend to be that weight in x weeks/months. I will add six projects in my portfolio in the x following weeks.

Wrong, wrong, wrong.   
The problem is the fact that our mind will be focused on the end-line but each day when we do exercises or write, or code, the end-line is far away. Motivation failed not because you're a lazy person but because it hasn't been designed to be used each day that much.    

Instead of the goals, you have to focus on something else: the system. How do you intend to reach your goals? What can you do to be 1% better? The repetition of the same task ("I will write each morning, after my meditation, at least one line" or "I will go swimming each Sunday morning") is the key,  the journey that will help to build you: to create an identity that will make you feel better and closer to what you desire.

Don't dream, act.
