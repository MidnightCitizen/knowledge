The circadian rhythm is a body-internal clock, a 24-hours cycle that regulate the functions of the body. 

**The sleep-wake cycle is the most critical part of the circadian rhythm**. 

In the day, with the help of light, alerts are send to the body to stay awake and be focus. In the evening, when night falls, an hormone called melatonin is produced to create a sleeping-effect. That's why humans works in the day and sleeps at the night.

If the sleep-wake is disturbed, sleep-deprivation can happened (with insomnia, or wake-up too early) and therefore it influences (in a bad way) almost all systems of the human body (productivity and health).

**How to have a good circadian rhythm**
- be exposed to the Sun
- same hour go to sleep, same hour wake up
- move, make exercises
- no stimulants
- zero light in the evening
- short nap
