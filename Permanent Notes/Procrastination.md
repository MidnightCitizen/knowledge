**Procrastination is a self-defeating behavior pattern.** 

Lack of structure or motivation, low self-confidence, and anxiety can explain the habit of avoiding unpleasant tasks. 

There is a degree of **self-deception**, a part of the brain focus on quick-pleasure-gain instead of rational decisions : the main enemy to deal with can be called **the Instant Gratification Monkey**

#### How to fight procrastination
* Plan your day
* Break a task to make small bricks
* Starting is difficult, doing is not
* Aim for slow, steady progress
