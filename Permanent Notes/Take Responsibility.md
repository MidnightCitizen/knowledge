Yes, we don't have full power of the events of our life, but there is still one thing that we have control whatever happens : *our judgment*, our opinion, our feeling. If something bad occurs, I have the responsibility to handle it, to deal with it. I can't blame the others, or a divinity, or said it's bad luck. I have to face it.
