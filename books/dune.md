## Quotes

> ❝ I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. ❞ 

## Remarks

A very interesting book that explores the behavior of human beings, whether it be the fall of House Atreides by the Emperor and the Harkonnen, the creation of a cult around Paul that frightens him, and the notion of clan/community established by the Fremen for several centuries. The novel sometimes gets a little lost in the meanders of Paul's mind, a good part of the story takes place there as he is more and more able to control his "Gift" of seeing the future, to see all the branches of the future that are taking shape before him. The secondary characters, unfortunately, are not treated well enough; at least, once Paul is in the desert of Arrakis, many of the characters, starting with his mother, become secondary, no longer having as much influence on the course of the story. This in any case contributes to what the author has tried to put in place: a sense of inevitable events, whether it be the death of Duke Leto Atreides through treason, and all that follows for Paul, which he perceives with varying degrees of accuracy. 

## Summary

A very good novel, following the footsteps of Paul, an exceptional young man thanks to a succession of genetic inheritances, but he only follows his destiny once he joins the Fremen, in the desert of Arrakis. His "initiatory" journey includes, above all, learning the customs and habits of the dune people. He becomes a leader, a legend, using a cult around his person to federate and build a relentless military force. And he uses it to capture the Emperor and force his hand regarding the marriage of his daughter and thus become the future emperor.
