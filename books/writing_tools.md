## Quotes

> ❝ More muscular than the comma, the semicolon is most useful to divide big chunks of information. ❞    
> ❝ But the dash has two brilliant uses: a pair of dashes can set off an idea contained within a sentence, and a dash near the end can deliver a punch line. ❞    
> ❝ All of us possess a reading vocabulary as big as a lake but draw from a writing vocabulary as small as a pond.❞    
> ❝ If it sounds like writing, writes hard-boiled novelist Elmore Leonard, I rewrite. ❞   
> ❝ ...she helped her writers created a cast of characters for their stories by asking the question *Who has something at stake here?*  ❞ 


> ❝ I believe that the so-called "writing block" is a product of some kind of disproportion between your standards and your performance... One should lower his standards until there is no felt threshold to go over in writing. It's easy to write. You just shouldn't have standards that inhibit you from writing. ❞  
> — William Stafford, Writing the Australia Crawl

## Remarks

Some tools are really good, the one called *Cut big, then small* shows with an example of how far the original draft can be from the final result. 

*Get the name of the dog* is also a key-concept that good story needs to have solid details.

Each tool needs time to get understand and used with intelligence. We develop a "style", we read and we think, but too much pressure can lead to the infamous blank page or, worse, to have an artificial style that it's the sum of good practices, creating a scholar essay instead of a living story.


## Summary

Fifty-five tools, from simple one (*fear not the long sentence*) to elaborate one (*build your work around a key question*); like the author said early on, **each item is a tool, not a rule**. You don't have to follow blindly each one to achieve a best-seller. 


Writing is an organic activity but there are some mistakes that you should avoid, some concepts that you need to have in mind. Otherwise, your style will be boring, or your story will lack coherence. Punctuation matters, blueprints, and habits are powerful tools to design and create ideas.
