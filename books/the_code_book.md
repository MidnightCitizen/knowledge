## Quotes

> ❝ Secret communication achieved by hiding the existence of a message is known as *steganorgraphy* ❞   
> ❝ The aim of cryptography is not to hide the existence of a message, but rather to hide its meaning, a process know as encryption. ❞   
> ❝ According to Sir Harry Hinsley, "the war, instead of finishing in 1945, would have ended in 1948 had the Government Code and Cypher School not been able to read the Enigma cyphers and produce the Ultra qintelligence." ❝

## Remarks
 
* Enigma was first cracked by Poland, but the start of the war (and the invasion of Poland) and increase complexity of the use of Enigma lead to the following breakthroung by Alan Turing in England.  
* The Great Cipher of Louis XIV was used to encrypt the most secret messages : one of them is about the famous myth of the Man in the Iron Mask, which seem to be not a twin of the king but a commander called Vivien de Bulond, that has been guilty of extreme cowardice.   
* Decryption has also be used to understand old civilization, to discover and understand ancient languages.
* RSA is a major breakthrough to secure and encrypt messages.

## Summary

A dive into the history of cryptography, of the "war" between those who encrypt and those who decrypt, with the different techniques and tools (Caesar's shift, frequency analysis, Vipher, Enigma, RSA, ..) used during centuries.

## Notes 
[[caesar_shift]]-> One of the first encryption method in the history
