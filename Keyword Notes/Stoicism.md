>“The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own.”    
> — Epictetus

Four virtues 
- Courage
- Temperance
- Justice
- Wisdom

Determine, each day, what is within your control, what is not
Reflect your life in a journal
Think about what you fear
Control your perception
Remember : you're ephemeral 
Take a bird's view
Meditate
Imagine what could go wrong
Embrace each obstacle, don't avoid it

>“If, at some point in your life, you should come across anything better than justice, truth, self-control, courage — it must be an extraordinary thing indeed.”   
> — Marcus Aurelius
