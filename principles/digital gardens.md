A digital garden is a **format** to have multiple notes of different subjects and use links between them instead of writing blog posts with dates. 

It's the same concept behind the method zettelkasten : create a network of ideas/informations, a great way to store and connect them with past knowledge

## Notes

[[zettelkasten]] -> a new way to write and store information
