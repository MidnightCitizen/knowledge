Collecting **feels** like learning. Feels. You are not a better developer because you have ten books about programming, or a good doctor because each morning you store in your Pocket-like application articles about medicine.

It's a mental state, in some way, you feel secure because you have see something useful, you store it, and if you ever need it, or if you allow yourself some time, you will be able to read it and understand it. But you never do that, or not in enough and you have a dozen of folders with good resources, hundred of bookmarks, etc.

Like the Impostor's syndrome, it is something that you have to know in order to fight it, and you fight the collector's fallacy by making sure that *each resource is useful and make it your own*. Use your own words to translate what you have understand, don't just use a copy-past. Also, each day, or each week, allow you at least 1-2 hours to review your notes, clippings, links and ideas. Store them in a system where you know you will be able to find it again in case you get more information, you want to update it or to make a connection with another concept.
