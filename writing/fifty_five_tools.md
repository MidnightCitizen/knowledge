## SHOWING vs. TELLING
1. Learn the difference between reports and stories.

# EDITTING

## GENERAL

2. Prefer the simple over the technical.   
*Use shorter words, sentences and paragraphs at points of complexity.*

## PARAGRAPHS

1. Vary the lengths of paragraphs.   
*Go short or long — or make a “turn” — to match your intent.*

2. Put odd and interesting things next to each other.   
*Help the reader learn from contrast.*

3. Repeat, repeat, repeat.   
*Purposeful repetition links the parts.*

## SENTENCES

1. Set the pace with sentence length.   
*Vary sentences to influence the reader’s speed.*

2. Let punctuation control pace and space.   
*Learn the rules, but realise you have more options than you think.*

*Make meaning early, then let weaker elements branch to the right.*

4. Order words for emphasis.   
*Place strong words at the beginning and at the end.*

5. Choose the number of elements with a purpose in mind.

*Build parallel constructions, but cut across the grain.*

7. Seek original images.

## WORDS: CHOICE

2. Play with words, even in serious stories.   
*Choose words the average writer avoids but the average reader understands.*

3. Riff on the creative language of others.

*Do not repeat a distinctive word unless you intend a specific effect.*

## WORDS: USE

1. In short pieces of writing, don’t waste a syllable.   
*Shape shorter works with wit and polish.*

2. Activate your verbs.   
*Strong verbs create action, save words, and reveal the players.*

3. Be passive-aggressive.  
*Use passive verbs to showcase the “victim” of action.*

4. Watch those adverbs.   
*Use them to change the meaning of the verb.*

5. Take it easy on the -ings.   
*Prefer the simple present or past.*
