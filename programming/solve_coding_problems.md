Against a problem, the urge to find out quickly a solution may lead to a poor answer or, even worse, an inaccurate answer. 

In programming, this is even more true. We have learned how to program, how to use variables and functions to achieve steps of process, but all of this can be useless without a methodology in order to tackle a programming-problem.

In 1945, *George PÃ³lya* created a simple method in a book called **How to Solve**.

**Four stages**
1. Understand the problem
    * read through the problem
    * inputs ?
    * outputs ?
    * check edge-cases
2. Devise a plan
    * step-by-step with pseudo-code
3. Carry out the plan
    * implement the solution
    * test-it
4. Look back
    * optimize / refactor
    * understand it at a glance ?
    * improve the performance of your solution ?
