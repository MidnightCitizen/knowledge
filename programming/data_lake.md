>❝ One common analogy is that a data lake is a like a real-world lake: an unfiltered and massive body of water. In comparison, a data warehouse is a bottle of water: filtered, clean and safe to drink. ❞

Traditional data storage is no longer sufficient in a world where there is always more information to store and especially to analyze. 
In addition to "classic" databases (SQL, for example), new elements have surfaced, notably warehouses and data lakes.

Their purpose is not to be used in production but to contain a very large volume of data that can then be used to generate reports or make predictions using machine learning. 

Data lakes therefore allow to store a lot of data but without a defined framework or a particular treatment. 
Other programs can then interoperate with this "data water mass" to extract interesting elements from it.
