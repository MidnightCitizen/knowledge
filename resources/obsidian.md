To fight the [collector fallacy](https://github.com/MidnightCitizen/knowledge/blob/master/principles/collector_fallacy.md) and get used to the [zettelkasten](https://github.com/MidnightCitizen/knowledge/blob/master/methods/zettelkasten.md) method, Obsidian is a perfect tool.

You can manage with it your notes, create links between each and get a visualization about this "second memory". It's quite simple to use, free and no need to learn any language because the notes are written in [markdown](https://github.com/MidnightCitizen/knowledge/blob/master/languages/markdown.md)
