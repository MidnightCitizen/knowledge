* Man at Arms has a "size". After recruiting them you can click on their portrait and increase their size for a price (Each size is 100 men)

* You can Force or Forbid knights on your military tab, clicking on the knights portrait.

* You need to raise troops again to refresh knights (They are not added automatically to an army when they are removed from there)

* You can click on your gathering point of your army and move it around to quickly deploy armies near the enemy border

* If your army is more than 2 months away from their destination and you have land nearby, you can disband them and raise them on your land 2 months later

* Prowess is mostly useful for knights, but doesn't affect a Commander skill

* Prowess is used in many events regarding duels or killing stuff (Hunting for example)

* If you're the top ruler of your realm you can't be a knight, only a commander

* The Cultural progress is based on development of your culture, you can pump up the development of the counties of your culture to have quicker technologies. In the same way, expanding your culture to low development counties could harm your technology gain.

* There are several levels of Prestige and Piety unrelated to your current mana pool of prestige and piety. The progress increase when you receive mana, but does not decrease when you spend mana.

* Having a lot of living dinasty members increase your dinasty reputation.

* You can sway a character several times over, to a maximum of 100 (Good way to keep powerful trash vassals on check)

* Vassals contracts works regardless of the vassal opinion. They'll pay even if they hate you to your guts.

* The rework plot system makes that you are not always able to know who is targetting you and you can't manually stop detected plots.

* Detecting or getting your plot detected will delay it by a lot. Your spymasters will usually delay plots targetted against you and rarely be able to fully expose them. If the AI feels like murdering you and doesn't stop, it will eventually have his chance, is just a matter of time.

* Each point of advantage over the enemy is a 2% damage increase.

* You can convert manually by going to the Religion tab, clicking on "Other Faiths" and looking for the desired faith

* You can change the Child lifestyle focus by clicking on icon on top of their name on the character view. This icon also shows the current character lifestyle.

* Congenital traits can be improved by marrying 2 characters with a trait of the same group (Example: If two Characters with the "Quick" trait have a child, the child can inherit the better "Intelligent" trait)

* You can change the current cultural fascination (A bonus to the research speed of a technology) if you're the cultural head of your Culture. You can click on the culture tab and then on the desired technology.

* To grab lot of lands quickly you can swap to an heretical religion and start declaring holy wars for counties. The AI seems to rarely join Holy Wars between heretical religions and you only need piety to do this. After expanding to the desired size, you can revert back to your old religion. I was able to conquer a 80% of Great Britain with the first ruler by doing this.

* Levies are basically canon fodder. Men at arm's and knights will melt them.

* Vassal limit scales with the title rank, 20 for dukes, 40 for kingdoms and 60 for empires.

* You can create multiple rally points in order to split your entire army into multiple stacks. You can then combine them, split them and also disband smaller parts of your army to meet your exact needs.

* You can fabricate hooks using one of the intrigue tree skills and then trade hooks for money using one skill in the steward tree. It is ridiculously powerful combination and can get you enough money to significantly improve your domain or win any war.

* Holy sites provide a unique building that gives a lot of bonuses to both the county holder and the realm.

* Depending on your religion, make sure your bishop likes you because the more he does, the more taxes and levies you get from clergy holdings.

* Avoid the shy and forgiving traits, as they make it so you receive a lot of stress from important actions related to vassals and prisoners (or roleplay to let your realm fall apart).

* How to move your capital: Click on the county you want to be your capital then click on the village/castle and there should be a button that looks like a crown to make it your new capital.

* How to raise only knights and men at arms: Raise all your troops, and without unpausing, split off your Men-At-Arms and knights(they should be the only ones raised at this point, but you need to move them all over, leaving the left side empty). Then move this new stack into any adjacent tile. All levies will disband automatically after 1 tick and you'll have just knights and M@A

* How to deal with aggressive bigger kingdoms: Alliances. Also the overall size of your realm isn't super important for army strength. Men-at-arms and knights are way more important than levies, so it's possible to have strong military even if with relatively small realm. (Example: If you manage to marry or get a bethrodal with the threatening kingdom they won't be able to attack you)

* Siege Weapons - I cannot stress this enough: Siege Weaponry MAA regiments are OP right now. Having just 10 onagers in your army cuts months (plural) off of siege times. With the increased map granularity, and the ability to board ships from anywhere, it's easy for the AI to just dodge your army if they don't want a fight. If you're sieging at two to three times their pace, the AI will spend most of it's time trying to unsiege it's own stuff, especially his capital. I currently have 90 mangonels in my army, and average siege time is under a month.

* Perk CB's - Many CB's are locked behind lifestyle perks with only a 2-3 point investment. If you're on your first ruler, I highly recommend Ducal Conquest and Forced Vassalization, which are both in the Diplomacy lifestyle, and allow you to rapidly expand without spending gold and time on claims.

* *'Multi-Classing" - There are a number of very powerful lifestyle perks at the start of lifestyle trees that require no prior investment to obtain. Don't be afraid to bounce around between lifestyles regularly. In my experience they lifestyle traits are nice, but they aren't gamechangers. Generally it's worth putting off completing one tree until you have all the low level perks you want.

* Secret Hunting - If you are a vassal, the best place to hunt for secrets is in your liege's court. They will almost certainly have 1 or more powerful vassals present as councilors as well as the top liege himself. If at first your spymaster comes up empty handed, don't give up right away, your chances of finding a secret are kind of middling unless you have a really good spymaster. That said, in the first few years, it might not be worth hunting for secrets, as it does take some time for secrets to build up.

* Sway - You should pretty much constantly be using sway unless you're using a different personal scheme already. It's literally free opinion boosts. Good targets include you liege, your powerful vassals, your religious head, and your personal bishop. Be wary of using the Friendship personal scheme against people older than you, you will gain stress when they die.

* Hostile Scheme Cooldowns - Unlike in CK2, cancelling a hostile scheme isn't completely free. Once you cancel the scheme you will be unable to prepare hostile plots against your target for some time (5-10 years, I don't remember exactly).

* Elective Succession - Even in CK2, elective was probably the best succession available to feudal Catholics, and now that non-partition successions are out of reach until late game, this is more true than ever. Elective successions can be obtained for any duke level or higher title by spending 1.5k prestige (a hefty price, but probably worth it) using the add succession law option. And with hooks and dread freely available, you're essentially unlocking heir designation.

* Dread - Collecting dread makes everything easier. It's always useful to have a half dozen religious prisoners in your jail at all times. Whenever your dread gets low you can execute some prisoners with no consequences because they're the wrong religion. This is especially useful on succession for keeping everybody in check. During my Matilda run, Queen Matilda died right after winning a crusade, and had a dozen Muslim prisoners in the dungeon. Her son, King Arrigio started his reign by executing a handful of them. Nobody even created a faction during his reign.

* Piety - While prestige seems to accumulate pretty well during natural gameplay, you really do have to try in order to collect a decent amount of piety. It can be useful to start off a reign with Theology Focus for the +1 piety/m plus the occasional piety providing event. So far, GHW's and Pilgrimages seem to be the main bulk sources of piety.
