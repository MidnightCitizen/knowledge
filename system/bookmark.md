With so much information available, it's impossible to retain everything. Bookmark can help but in the end it will only make us fall in the collector’s fallacy :
>‟the tendency to collect heaps of information without ever doing anything useful with it”
> - David B. Clear, [Blog Post](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125)

This repository is a step to avoid such failure and to create a useful storage system. 

Side effects bonus :
* You’ll learn better
* You’ll focus better
* You’ll be less frustrated
* You’ll waste less time
* You’ll think better
