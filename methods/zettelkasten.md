Our memory is powerful but has a lot of flaws, and we don't even use it as we should. We lost time and knowledge.

The **Zettelkasten's Method** aim to fix that by giving us a methology to handle new ideas, to store them and to connect them with past knowledge.

For example, you can read a book about good habits and read two years later another piece of knowledge related to techniques in order to help establish habits in your life : you don't remember now what were the good habits, so you have to read the book again.

No matters how many books or articles you have read, what matters is the knowledge and what you do with it. That's the Zettelkasten philosophy. 

You need notes, to create something from each piece of information with your own words and to have it in a system that store all precedents ideas.

This repository is one implementation but the same process can be used with papers or softwares. The main goal is to store the information and to make it easy to find it again or to link it with another knowledge.

## Notes

[[collector fallacy]] -> Dozen of bookmarks or books that you store don't give you any value, only the illusion of reachable knowledge
