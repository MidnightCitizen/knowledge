>Eudaimonia is a Greek word commonly translated as **happiness** or **welfare**; however, *human flourishing or prosperity* have been proposed as more accurate translations

This is not a "scientific" concept, neither it is well defined or explained. It is sometimes described also as a divinity, or an idea of perfection. 

In stoicism, it has been used to describe the **eu** (*good*) **daimōn** (*spirit*) that lived inside you, the ultimate version of yourself that can exist. 

This ideal can never be fully reached of course but the goal is not to became your eudaimōn but to use each day to get closer to it, to have a good relationship with it. If you live with harmony with your eudaimōn, you will be a better human being and fulfill your potential, with the side effect to be happy.
