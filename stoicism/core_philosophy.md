A visualization may prove handy to explain stoicism.

The core concept is **eudaimonia** that can be summarized to live with prosperty, and being close as much close possible to our inner daimon (the best version of yourself). 


**Live with aretÃ©** is the first corner of the triangle, it means to live with virtue, to be excellent in every occasion : you have to be at your best as much as possible to become a better human being.  

**Focus on what you control** is a core principle of stoicism : they are things that you can have an impact, and a lot more where you have no power. You have to know in which category something that bothers you is : if you can do something, do it, otherwise accept it and move on. 

**Take responsibility** can be strange to understand with the precedent point that said that some things are not in our control. Yes, we don't have full power of the events of our life, but there is still one thing that we have control whatever happens : *our jugment*, our opinion, our feeling. If something bad occurs, I have the responsibility to handle it, to deal with it. I can't blame the others, or a divinity, or said it's bad luck. I have to face it. 

Each concept is a key to open the door of the philosophy of stoicism, and being able to understand it, and to use it daily can make us improve as human being and getting closer and closer to the idea of happiness.
