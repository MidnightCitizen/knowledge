# Powerful quotes 

>“If, at some point in your life, you should come across anything better than justice, truth, self-control, courage — it must be an extraordinary thing indeed.”   
> — Marcus Aurelius

>“The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own.”    
> — Epictetus

>“It is in times of security that the spirit should be preparing itself for difficult times; while fortune is bestowing favors on it is then is the time for it to be strengthened against her rebuffs.” 
> — Seneca

>“Alexander the Great and his mule driver both died and the same thing happened to both.”    
>— Marcus Aurelius
