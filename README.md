## Definition

Store all the valuable knowledge that I can read, see or heard in a system of notes-tags-links. Not only to remember it, but to think *better*.

## Trigger

Reading is a waste of time if the knowledge is not stored, the short-term memory makes us believe that we are wiser after reading a book.
It's not the case. This *knowledge* is designed to be working with the software [[obsidian]].

## Principles 

* Centralized: all-in-one place
* Simple: add and find notes with no pain
* Organized: tags and links between notes to create a "web"
* Sharing: easy read access with github link

## Rules

* A folder is equal to a tag
* No folder in a folder
* One and only one idea by note
* A note is independent
* Each note has to be linked to at least one note
* As much as possible: **no copy-pasted information**
* Add references to a note (less than five)

## Notes

[[zettelkasten]] && [[digital gardens]] -> concepts behind this repository to "*create*" a second memory, store and connect ideas
