Store all the valuable knowledge that I can read, see, or heard in a system of notes-tags-links.

## Trigger

Reading is a waste of time if the knowledge is not stored, the short-term memory makes us believe that we are more wise after reading a book : it's not the case.

## Principles 

* Centralized : all-in-one place
* Simple : add and find notes with no pain
* Organized : tags and links between notes to create a "web"
* Sharing : easy read access 

## Rules

* A folder is equal to a tag
* No folder in a folder
* One and only one idea by note
* A note is independant
* Each note has to be linked to at least two other notes
* Explanation for each link between notes
* As much as possible : no copy-pasted information
* Add references to a note (less than five)
* Never delete a note, link to a new one instead
