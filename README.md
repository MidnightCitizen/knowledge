## Definition

Store all the valuable knowledge that I can read, see or heard in a system of notes-tags-links. Not only to remember it, but to think *better*.

## Trigger

Reading is a waste of time if the knowledge is not stored, the short-term memory makes us believe that we are wiser after reading a book but it's not the case. 
This ​​knowledge​​ is designed to be working with the software ​​obsidian​​.

## Principles 

* Centralized: all-in-one place
* Simple: add and find notes with no pain
* Organized: tags and links between notes to create a "web"
* Sharing: easy read access with github link

## Principles v2

Instead of folders that each represent a category, it has been breakdown by fleeting notes, permanent notes and literature notes. The goal behind that is to allow new ideas to emerge from notes in different subjects, create bridges where there was none.

## Rules

* `  ~~A folder is equal to a tag~~
* No folder in a folder
* One and only one idea by note
* A note is independent
* Each note has to be linked to at least one note
* As much as possible: **no copy-pasted information**
* No orphan notes
