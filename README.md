# knowledge

## Description

Store all the knowledge that I can read, see, or heard.

## Trigger

> Reading is a waste of time if the knowledge is not stored, the short-term memory makes us believe that we are more wise after reading a book : it's not the case.
> - Myself, after reading a [blog post](ttps://chrisman.github.io/11.html) and discover the [Zettelkasten method](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125)

## Goal 
Four principles in order to make the storage useful

* Centralized : all-in-one place
* Simple : add and find notes with no pain
* Organized : tags and links between notes to create a "web"
* Sharing : easy read access
